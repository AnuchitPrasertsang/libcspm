0.2.1 Thomas Gibson-Robinson <thomas.gibsonrobinson@gmail.com> 2012-01-18
    * Fixed a bug in the typechecker that prevented certain (uncommon)
      functions that took function arguments that were polymorphic in dot from
      being type checked.
    * Exposed ErrorMessages to allow clients to present them more usefully.
    * Added location information to renamer errors.
    * Made compatible with GHC 7.0.4.

0.2.0 Thomas Gibson-Robinson <thomas.gibsonrobinson@gmail.com> 2012-01-04
    * Enhanced the evaluator:
        * Dot is not handled correctly;
        * More versions of infinite sets are allowed;
        * Add experimental and partial support of $ in prefixes.
      This should mean that the evaluator has feature parity with FDR2, 
      although it does lack testing.
    * Added a renamer that renames all variables in a file or expression to
      ensure that they do not clash.
    * Enhanced the parser to be more compatible with FDR2 with regard to the
      ambiguity with > and end of sequence. See the comment in 
      src/CSPM/Parser.hs.
    * Fixed a bug in the typechecker where it would incorrectly allow yield
      types to be chosen in prefixes. For example, given c?x?y:{0,1} where
      c is a channel that has only one field, of type A, the typechecker would
      assign a type of Int=>A for x, which does not match the evaluator which
      would assign x to the whole A. To fix this a new type constraint was 
      added, Inputable, that any type other than yield satisfies.
    * Added a lot more documentation, particularly on the abstract syntax tree
      and how to use the library.

0.1.2 Thomas Gibson-Robinson <thomas.gibsonrobinson@gmail.com> 2011-11-04
    * Fix building with GHC 7.2 and Alex 3.
    * Remove the last few remaining mentions to sfdr (the old name for
      cspmchecker).
